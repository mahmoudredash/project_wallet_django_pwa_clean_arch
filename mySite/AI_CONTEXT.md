# AI Assistant Context

You are working inside a Django PWA project that follows Clean Architecture.

Rules:

- Never place business logic inside Django views.
- Never import Django ORM inside domain layer.
- Use repository pattern.
- Follow dependency inversion.
- Write testable code.
- Keep layers strictly separated.
- Do not break folder boundaries.

If unsure, ask before adding cross-layer dependency.
